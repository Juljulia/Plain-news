### Code Review
By Erik Johannesson
* functions#25-28 - remove one tab space for consistency.
* functions#26 - use === instead of == for better practise.
* data#25-115 - change key from author to authorId to make it easier to understand the number.
* index#30-47 - You have good structure on your code, which made it easy to read and understand.
* index#39&42 - Maybe remove the date class and likesborder class since they are not used in css.
